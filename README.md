# GoGrab

GoGrab stands for `GO:Generate Regex Automated Boilerplate`, and aimed to be a very simple tool to automate the generation of boilerplate code using regular expressions.

Unfortunately, the syntax of go:generate and it's inability to handle indented comments makes this idea ugly and impractical, so I abandoned this repository
